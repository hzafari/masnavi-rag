Unless you gain possession of the candle, there is no wayfaring;\nand when you have come on to the way, your wayfaring is the Path; and when you have reached the journeys\nend; that is the T ruth.

Each party is rejoicing in what they have.\nOr the Law may be compared to learning the science of medicine, and the Path to regulating ones diet in\naccordance with medicine and taking remedies, and the T ruth to gaining health everlasting and becoming in\ndependent of them both.  When a man dies to this life, the Law and the Path are cut off from him, and there\nremains the T ruth.

Oh, would that it had been the decision! My riches have not availed me; my authority has\nperished from me.\nThe Law is knowledge, the Path action, the T ruth attainment unto God.
